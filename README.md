## Introduction
The script essentially reads in the test and training data from the given dataset and merged into one single data set. The readme will give the flow of the script and the general function that it does.
## Data read in
- The script reads in the activity labels that allow one to assign activities to the numeric number indicated in the X_test.txt and X_train.txt
- The script reads in the features label for each kind of measurements that were made. The list of features are given in the features.txt.
- The script reads in the actual data for the test and training set (y_test.txt and y_train.txt)
